<p>A regard for your good opinion, and a wish to promote
the cause, which, as Abolitionists, lies near our hearts, is our
motive for addressing you. We think the opposition to our
enterprise arises either from commercial, political or domestic
connections with Slavery, or from misapprehensions
respecting our principles, measures and prospects. We desire
no better means of overcoming these obstacles than a
fair statement of facts; and to this we now solicit your attention.</p>
</div>


<h2 class="nobreak">DECLARATION OF SENTIMENTS.</h2>

<p>We believe that all men are born free and equal, and endowed
by their Creator with certain inalienable rights,
among which are life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.</p>

<p>We believe Slavery is an infraction of these rights, a
violation of the principles of christianity, and under all
circumstances sinful.</p>

<p>We believe that Slavery is a great national evil, political as
well as moral, opposed to the genius of a republican government,
highly dangerous to the peace and permanency of the
Union, and if persisted in, destined to bring upon us the
severest judgments of Heaven.</p>

<p>We believe the immediate abolition of slavery would be
safe and wise, and that it is the duty of every friend of humanity
to use all fair and just means for its accomplishment.</p>

<p>We believe we have a right to express and publish our
opinions respecting the customs and institutions of the people
of this and every other country; and if we think them in
any degree immoral, unequal, or oppressive, we are under
the highest obligations, in the exercise of all honest and
lawful means, to change them.</p>

<p>We believe that Slavery in the several states can be lawfully
abolished only by the legislatures of the states in which
it prevails, and that the exercise of any other than moral
means to induce such abolition, is unconstitutional.</p>

<p>We believe that Congress has a right to abolish Slavery
in the District of Columbia, and in the Territories, and to
prohibit the slave trade between the states, and that the exercise
of this right is required by the divine law, and by the
interests of our country.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_4"></a>[4]</span></p>

<p>We believe that no class of men can rightfully be denied,
<em>on account of their color</em>, the enjoyment of equal rights with
others, in the protection, immunities and administration of
the government under which they live.</p>


<h2 class="nobreak">UTILITY OF THESE SENTIMENTS.</h2>

<p>These are our sentiments. We regret to say they are not
collectively the sentiments of our countrymen. It is for our
zeal in propagating them, that we have been assailed with
unmeasured abuse and lawless violence. We think it of
high importance to our country and the world that they
should be received by all the people. What the effect of
their general reception in the free states would be, is very
apparent.</p>

<p><em>We should abolish Slavery in the District of Columbia.</em>
There Congress has exclusive jurisdiction on all subjects
whatsoever, including of course the subject of Slavery.—This
is admitted by Martin Van Buren, Henry Clay, and
an overwhelming majority of the present Congress. The
Abolitionists are to a man in favor of the exercise of this
right. If, therefore, the free states were <em>thoroughly</em> abolitionized,
their Senators and Representatives, who yet compose
a majority in Congress, would at once bow to the
supremacy of their constituents, and abolish Slavery.</p>

<p><em>We should prohibit the inter state Slave-Trade.</em> This
trade has recently been carried on to a greater extent than
ever was the foreign slave trade; it being estimated that not
less than 120,000 slaves were exported from Virginia alone,
within little more than a year, and removed for the most
part to the southwestern states. Four of these states are said
by their own papers, to have received within the same period,
about 250,000 slaves from the old states. How many
tender ties have in one short year been broken by this detestable
business! How much bodily suffering has been
endured! How much guilt has been contracted! This
cruel and wicked traffic is at the foundation of a system of
breeding slaves for market, which is prosecuted on a large
scale, corrupting all concerned, by its licentiousness and barbarity.
Congress has a right to prohibit and suppress this
trade, under that article of the Constitution which empowers
Congress to regulate commerce with foreign nations and
between the several states. Were a majority of the citizens
of the free states decided Abolitionists, this right could be
exercised. We should insist upon it. Why then do not<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_5"></a>[5]</span>
they, who profess to regard the <em>slave trade</em> as the worst
feature of Slavery, join with us against it?</p>

<p><em>We should prevent the annexation of Texas to the United
States.</em> The South has long had her eye on that fine and
extensive country, intending to get it by purchase or stratagem,
for the purpose of opening a market for her redundant
slave population, and of securing the balance of power in
the general government to the slave-holding interest. Every
enemy of Slavery and friend of <em>free</em> labor, ought to oppose
this design. We apprehend that if the annexation of Texas
to our country should not involve us in war with Mexico and
Great Britain, it would either lead to a dissolution of the
union, or indefinitely prolong the existence of Slavery. The
Abolitionists are now preparing petitions to Congress, protesting
against this insane measure; and were the citizens of
the free states generally to join them, and load the tables of
Congress with several millions of signatures to these protests,
the danger would be averted. But they will not do it, <em>because</em>
they are not Abolitionists; and we must, therefore, in
all probability <em>take</em> Texas.</p>

<p><em>We should admit no new slave states to the Union.</em> Had
our sentiments prevailed when the Missouri question was
decided, the fine soil of that state would not now be cursed
with Slavery. She was admitted to the union by northern
men. They legalized the sin. It is a sad proof of the corruption
of <em>our</em> public sentiment that several of these traitors
to liberty, have, since that disgraceful vote was given, been
elevated to the first offices in the gift of New England; and
this without any signs of their repentance. Arkansas has
also been lately admitted to the Union by northern votes,
with the singular provision in her constitution, that her
legislature shall have no power to abolish Slavery; so that
the “peculiar institution” may last until the greatest knave
in the state is heartily weary and ashamed of it. Northern
men thus voted for <em>perpetual</em> Slavery; and this they did in
the confident expectation of being re-elected to Congress.
Had they known a majority of their constituents to be Abolitionists,
they would have voted differently. Should Florida
be <em>next</em> admitted to the Union as a <em>slave</em> state, the south
will have a majority in the Senate. Who can predict the
consequences? But were the free states thoroughly abolitionized,
Florida would never come into the Union as a <em>slave</em>
State; for Abolitionists are in <em>principle</em> opposed to it.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_6"></a>[6]</span></p>

<p><em>We should also prohibit the slave trade between the United
States and Texas.</em> In the constitution of Texas, whose
independence has already been acknowledged by our government,
Slavery is established as a permanent institution
of the country, and a monopoly of the slave trade
granted to the United States. Already thousands of slaves
have been sent there, and unless something is done to prevent
it, vessels will soon be fitted out in northern ports, to carry
slaves from Virginia to Texas, as well as to New Orleans;
and this, whether Texas is annexed to the United States, or
remains independent. Were the citizens of the free states
generally Abolitionists, they would not allow a legal commerce
in slaves from our Republic to a foreign nation.</p>

<p><em>We should save our own youth from the pollution and
guilt of Slavery.</em> They would not directly participate in it.
When they go to the South they would neither buy nor
<em>hire</em> slaves. Hitherto nothing has been more common than
for our best and most intelligent young men, the sons of our
ministers and church members, to become slave-holders.
At home they were not taught the inherent and necessary
sinfulness of Slavery; at the South the practice was recommended
to them by the example and plausible pretexts of the
best men. They were accustomed from their childhood to
see slave-holders treated with respect because they were rich
in human chattels, without hearing a word respecting the
<em>extortion</em> by which their wealth comes. Hence many of
the merchants, physicians, lawyers, planters, teachers and
clergymen of the South, though northern men by birth, are
either slave-holders or abettors of the system. This would
not be the case, had our declaration of sentiments been taught
from the first by our parents and teachers, and been made the
<em>cherished</em> creed of the free states. Then the combined instructions
of the nursery, of the school, and of the pulpit,
together with the impressive power of a sound public sentiment,
would have <em>established</em> our youth in the love and
veneration of human rights; in sympathy for the colored
man; in hatred of oppression. Thus would the general
reception of our sentiments withdraw from Slavery one of its
main supports, and at the same time rescue our sons and
daughters from the unutterable calamity of becoming rich
by the spoiling of the poor.</p>

<p><em>We should establish the liberties of the free states on a
firm foundation.</em> We are not so connected with the slave-states
that we must necessarily perish in their ruin. If the
judgments of heaven should overtake them, we may be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_7"></a>[7]</span>
spared; should their liberties be prostrated, ours may survive.
It depends on our character and conduct. A people
who respect the rights of others, will have their own rights
respected. Regarding man, of whatever color and condition,
as entitled to the sacred rights of liberty, of property,
and of personal security, they will neither forge chains for
others, nor suffer chains to be imposed on themselves. Nor
will God forsake them. Such are the character and security
of Abolitionists. Read our declaration of sentiments. We
go for <em>human nature</em>. We protest against Slavery, because
it is an infraction of the rights of <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span>. We know that our
entire country has forfeited her freedom, by oppressing the
colored man; still we believe we may, by hearty repentance
and the adoption of just and humane sentiments, appease the
wrath of heaven, and should our nation be rent in two, preserve
our own liberties. But if we continue to connive at
this wickedness, nothing is more certain than our ruin in the
common destruction of the country.</p>

<p><em>The free people of color would rapidly improve in their
moral and physical condition.</em> A load of prejudice now
crushes them in the dust. They cannot rise because they
are deprived of the motives and facilities for self-improvement.
They are a proscribed people. <span class="smcap">It is a calamity
in this Christian country to be born with a
colored skin.</span> It shuts out human beings from schools
and colleges, from the mechanical arts, from the house of
God, from a share in the government of the nation, from
social intercourse with their fellow-creatures, from the best
incitements to virtue and enterprise. We freely confess,
that the Abolitionists, if a majority, would correct all these
evils, and cause men in this so called christian and democratic
country, to be treated, according to the bible without
distinction of color.</p>

<p><em>We should do much to vindicate the honor and truth of
christianity.</em> Slavery is the <em>strongest</em> hold of infidelity at
the South, and a <em>strong</em> hold at the North. It is so because,
while natural religion declares Slavery to be sinful, the ministers
and professors of christianity practice it, and defend
their conduct from the bible. Such a religion, says the infidel
cannot be from God. It is thus that the church is bringing
into contempt and doubt our blessed religion. It would
greatly counteract this prolific cause of infidelity, were all
our churches, ministers, and theological professors, to embrace
and advocate the true doctrine of human rights as it<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_8"></a>[8]</span>
is set forth in the word of God. We should then hold up
to the world, this internal evidence of the divine origin of the
bible, that, being written in ages of darkness and despotism,
it notwithstanding clearly recognizes and protects <span class="allsmcap">MAN</span> as
the possessor of natural, inalienable, sacred rights. Instead
of doing this, many northern preachers of the gospel, are
now blaspheming their religion, by saying that both Moses
and Christ tolerated Slavery.</p>

<p><em>We should no longer uphold Slavery by recognizing
slave-holders as brethren in good and regular standing in
the Church.</em> We now receive to the table of the Redeemer,
without one word of admonition, men, who at the South,
make merchandize of the image of God, of their fellow-christians.
What is still more astonishing if not more
wicked, we receive slave-holders to our pulpits, to preach to
us about loving God and <span class="smcap">Man</span>! Thus we practically say,
that Slavery is consistent both with morality and the gospel
of Christ. Were we Abolitionists, it would be far otherwise;
for they do not think it right to lend the sanction of
the church to such outrageous wickedness.</p>

<p>Such would be <em>some</em> of the happy results of the general
adoption of our sentiments in the free states, if nothing more
could be effected. But we doubt not it would issue in <span class="smcap">the
peaceable abolition of Slavery by the several
slave states</span>. This is the principal object of our enterprise;
and on a strong probability of success, we are willing
to rest its character.</p>

<p><em>The constitutional action of Congress in the ways above
named, would do much to induce the South to abolish Slavery.</em>
Its abolition in the District of Columbia by the
assembled wisdom of the country, would exert a powerful
influence on the southern mind. It would be the testimony
of the nation, corroborating the testimony of every truly
civilized and christian people, to the impolicy and wickedness
of Slavery. The prohibition of the inter state slave-trade,
and the confinement of Slavery to its present local
limits would render it unprofitable to the old states, which
depend on this trade as the chief source of profit; and also
drive the new states to the necessity of introducing free labor;
for how could they otherwise cultivate their immense tracts
of virgin land, or supply the deficit occasioned by the rapid
consumption of life on their cotton and sugar plantations?</p>

<p>We should make a still more <em>direct appeal to her interests</em>,
by saying: <em>You may keep your cotton, rice, and sugar,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_9"></a>[9]</span>
until you have abolished Slavery. We shall no longer use
the products of unrequited labor.</em> It would then be a question
of dollars and cents with her, whether or not she would
give liberty to her captives. We should not be obliged to
deny ourselves the use of her productions one year; for her
states would vie with each other to see which could obtain a
monopoly of northern patronage by first abolishing Slavery.
Many northern men have been bought by southern patronage
to <em>do wrong</em>; is it not equally possible to buy the south
with northern patronage to <em>do right</em>; Human nature is
every where the same. We should indeed regret to have
Slavery abandoned from an exclusive regard to self-interest.
We would rather it should be destroyed by the spirit of repentance;
for then the emancipated slave would still be
treated with justice and humanity. But no means of bringing
the South to repentance can be more promising, than the
<em>conscientious</em> refusal, by northern men, of all sects and parties,
to sustain Slavery, by consuming its produce. At present
this cannot be done on a scale sufficiently large to
secure, certainly and immediately, the abolition of Slavery;
but were the North completely abolitionized, no doubt she
would do it with the most triumphant success.</p>

<p><em>We should move the South to abandon Slavery, by appealing
to her love of reputation.</em> The South shows herself
sensitive on this point. Said Mr. Calhoun in the United
States Senate, “do they, [his southern opponents,] expect the
Abolitionists will resort to arms, and commence a crusade
to liberate our slaves by force? Is this what they mean
when they speak of the attempt to abolish Slavery? If so
let me tell our friends of the South who differ from us, that
the war which the Abolitionists wage against us is of a very
different character and <em>far more effective</em>—it is waged not
against our <em>lives</em>, but our <em>character</em>.” Had he said <em>our
reputations and consciences</em>, he would have told the truth.
We do intend to make Slavery <em>disgraceful</em>. Sin ought to
be esteemed a reproach to any people. Were all northern
men of our way of thinking, this sin would be as infamous as
any other kind of <ins class="corr" id="tn-9" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'fraud and villany'">
fraud and villainy</ins>. The <em>world</em> is now
pointing the finger of scorn at <em>slave-holding America</em>. The
free states bear a merited portion of the shame, because we
share largely in the responsibility. As we have taken
Slavery under our patronage, and consented to stand godfather
to it, what little respectability we have, is thrown
around it, to the great relief and joy of its southern parents.<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_10"></a>[10]</span>
Let us retire from the relation. Instead of defending Slavery,
let us reiterate the just and indignant censures of the civilized
world, until all shall feel, that so great an enormity
cannot be practiced or connived at, without a forfeiture of
character. This would be the state of feeling, were the citizens
of the north generally Abolitionists; and he knows little
of human nature, who doubts that <em>such</em> a state of feeling,
would render the condition of a slave-holder, the last to be
sought, the first to be abandoned.</p>

<p>In these ways, if in no others, we could reach and influence
the South. Although she should attempt to shut out
the light by a strict censorship of the press and post-office;
though she should make the utterance of our sentiments on
southern soil an offence against her laws; she could not
prevent the constitutional action of the general government;
she could not compel us to consume her produce; she could
not escape the withering contempt and indignant frown of
our virtuous public sentiment. We could reach her heart
in these ways, in spite of herself, and as we think to the certain
overthrow of Slavery. We could do more.</p>

<p><span class="smcap">We could convert the South to the practical
adoption of our sentiments by enlightening her
conscience.</span> This is the principal ground of our confidence.
If Slavery is sinful, we can prove it to be such; and
this proof, made plain to the understanding of the South, cannot
fail to awaken her conscience. Such is human nature.
Some would have us think that none but christians have
consciences, and therefore the first step to be taken for the
removal of Slavery is to send missionaries to convert the
masters to christianity, thus laying a foundation for successful
appeals to the conscience. But it seems to us the work
of centuries, if not an impracticable work, to convert the
masters, or a majority of them, to true holiness, while Slavery
lasts, <em>especially if they have no consciences</em>; and we think
also, if all were converted to such a christianity as consists
with a hearty belief that <em>Slavery is not condemned by the
Bible</em>, it would not much facilitate our enterprise. Nor
have we so much contempt for that word, which is mighty
through God to the pulling down of strong holds, as to doubt
that <em>our doctrines</em> will commend themselves to the <em>reason</em> of
our southern brethren, and receive a fruitful response from
their <em>consciences</em>.</p>

<p>Some would have the world believe, if every person in
the free states were an Abolitionist, it would not hasten<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_11"></a>[11]</span>
<ins class="corr" id="tn-11" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the emancipatton of'">
the emancipation of</ins> the slaves; for, say they, we could not then
get a hearing at the south, and if we could, she is too much
exasperated at our interference to do any thing on the subject.
In our opinion, they are entirely mistaken.</p>

<p>We believe <em>we can get a hearing at the South, or convey
a knowledge of our sentiments to the southern mind, and that
these sentiments are more potent than her prejudices and
passions</em>. In proof of it—</p>

<p><em>She is now constantly receiving numerous publications
containing our views.</em> There were, the last year, about
five hundred regular southern subscribers to the publications
of the American Anti-Slavery Society. The Cincinnati
Philanthropist, the Alton Observer, the New York Evangelist,
and scores of other papers, religious and political,
have subscribers at the South, with whom from week to
week <ins class="corr" id="tn-11a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'they abvocate this'">
they advocate this</ins> cause. Many valuable anti-slavery
books are also doing a good work in the very midst of the
evil. Several thousands of Miss Grimke’s Appeal, together
with the writings of Jay, Child, Channing and others, are
daily tearing off the mask from Slavery, and awakening the
slumbering conscience of the South. Not unfrequently
slave-holders themselves come to the anti-slavery office in
New York and buy whole sets of our publications. The
speeches of her Senators, and the messages of her Governors
evince a better acquaintance with our writings and movements
than the great men of the North can boast. Her own
press is doing much to disseminate our sentiments. The
United States Telegraph of February 18, 1837, edited by
Duff Green, Washington, D. C., was nearly half filled with
extracts from our prints. Her clergy by publishing apologies
for slavery in refutation of our views, are also making
these views known and waking up a spirit of inquiry. Indeed,
such is human nature, and such is the course of the
south, that we have come to believe she will not allow us at
the north to <em>think aloud on the subject of Slavery without
knowing what we think and why we think so. She will not
allow us to form and express opinions on this subject</em> <span class="allsmcap">WITHOUT
KNOWING OUR OPINIONS AND THE GROUNDS OF
THEM</span>. She is too much interested, and knows that we have
too much power, to pass our sentiments by in utter contempt
without even ascertaining them.</p>

<p>But were the free states completely abolitionized, not only
the presses of the Anti-Slavery Societies, assisted by a few
others, would carry our doctrines to the South; but <em>all the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_12"></a>[12]</span>
religious, political and commercial papers of the North, indeed
the whole body of our literature, would breathe the
same spirit, would speak the same language</em>. Were she,
therefore, ever so much averse to the truth, these numberless
publications, aided by the English press and by private correspondence,
would force upon her a knowledge of our faith.</p>

<p><em>The social intercourse of the North and South would also
afford us ample opportunities for publishing our sentiments.</em>
The citizens of every state in the Union are daily meeting
in the steam-boats, coaches, rail-road cars and hotels of our
country. We are constantly <em>walking arm in arm</em> with the
South, so that she cannot fail to learn what we think of Slavery,
and of the duty and pre-eminent safety of immediate
emancipation. If we are decided Abolitionists, we shall certainly
talk enough to let her know <em>what</em> we think and <em>why</em>
we think so.</p>

<p><em>Many of the youth of the South must continue, as in times
past, to be educated in the free states.</em> Mr. Calhoun was
educated at Yale College. Who can doubt that an influence
might have been exerted on his mind, in relation to Slavery,
of the most happy character, if the officers of that institution,
if the surrounding community, if the literature of the day,
had all breathed the spirit of Arthur Tappan and Gerritt
Smith? There are now hundreds of southern youth in our
schools, and hundreds will succeed them, whose minds would
be set in deadly and deathless hostility to the robbery of
God’s poor, were their teachers Abolitionists. Some think
that in such an event, they would be kept at home. A few
might be, but not all. The salubrity of our climate, the excellence
of our institutions, the comparative purity of our morals,
give us an advantage, that the more virtuous and intelligent
of southern parents, would not relinquish, for fear that
their sons should embrace views, which in their own hearts
they must approve.</p>

<p>It should also be remembered, that we not only educate
the most precious youth of the South, but we <em>supply many
of her pulpits, professorships, and shops with our own sons</em>.
The great body of southern merchants are northern men.
Such is the genius of Slavery that this will continue to be
the case. The result would be, were we all Abolitionists,
that the adopted sons of the South would soon form a strong
body of opposition to Slavery, laboring to overthrow it, by
their votes, their arguments and their example. Some may
think that lynch law would then drive us all from the South;<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_13"></a>[13]</span>
or that we should be received there only on condition of letting
Slavery alone. They are mistaken. Were we <em>all</em>
Abolitionists, we should be defended. The national government
would protect us. The constitution guarantees the
rights of a citizen in all the states to the citizens of each state;
and had the North been thoroughly abolitionized, she would
have demanded and obtained redress for the blood of her
innocent citizens, who have been hung without color of law,
by southern ruffians. Be assured when we all become Abolitionists,
an end will be put to the reign of terror in every
part of the country. Men of all creeds and colors, will then
go where they please, speak what they please, and do what
they please, with perfect safety, so long as they commit no
offence against just and impartial law.</p>

<p><em>The interests of a large class at the South must predispose
them to favor our enterprise.</em> Probably not more than
half of the whites are directly interested in the continuance
of Slavery. Many hire Slaves, who could on equally eligible
terms, and with more peace of conscience, hire them as
<em>free</em> laborers, were they emancipated. Some own land without
slaves; and it is admitted, that immediately on the abolition
of Slavery, the soil would rise in value, and continue
to appreciate with the general improvement of the country.
A multitude of the whites are too poor to own slaves, and
too ignorant to obtain a living, except by manual labor, and
Slavery makes that disreputable, and comparatively unprofitable.
All these classes need only open their eyes, to
see that Slavery is subversive of their interests: and we may
therefore rationally calculate on having their attention and
sympathy.</p>

<p><em>What we have already effected at the South, is a pledge
of entire success</em>, the moment the leading influences at the
North shall second our efforts instead of counteracting
them. Several hundred slaves have been set at liberty
through the labors of those two distinguished Abolitionists,
David Nelson and James G. Birney. We have heard of
various other instances in which our doctrines have had
such successful access to the southern mind. We will mention
one. Some time since, in New York, a gentleman rose
in a monthly concert of prayer for the slaves, and said: “I
am a slave-holder from Virginia. I came to the North with
violent prejudices against the Abolitionists, in consequence
of what I read in northern papers; but I was determined
to investigate the matter for myself. Accordingly I<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_14"></a>[14]</span>
sought lodgings in the family of an Abolitionist, obtained and
read your publications, and attended this monthly concert;
and I am now convinced that not only your doctrines but
your measures are righteous.” And he added, turning to
two gentlemen who sat beside him, “these gentlemen are
also slave-holders from Virginia, and my first converts to
abolitionism; and I know a thousand men in Virginia, who
if they could have the truth stated to them, would agree with
us.” He then exhorted the Abolitionists present to go on,
saying “you have only to correct the public sentiment of the
North so that their papers shall not misrepresent you at the
South, and <span class="allsmcap">THE WORK IS DONE</span>.” Besides many such
facts evincive of the power of truth over the southern mind,
and proving that the leaven is working there, we have frequent
admissions from the lips and pens of the defenders of
Slavery at the South, that the Abolitionists are disturbing the
conscience of her people, that there is more sympathy with
them there than it would be prudent to acknowledge; that if
the fanatics are suffered to go on they will succeed; that
they <em>may</em> build up a body of public sentiment which the
South cannot resist. These facts, these admissions, and the
very nature of man, convince us that we have many allies at
the South. The violence of the friends of Slavery, has
forced them to a temporary silence; but no doubt many of
them long to unburden their hearts, and are only waiting to
be sustained by a healthy public sentiment among us.—Were
we all Abolitionists, it would be less odious and less
hazardous to avow our sentiments at the South; and she
would find a body of Abolitionists on her own soil, too
respectable to be despised—too strong to be resisted.</p>

<p>Our expectations of success in making known our sentiments
to our southern brethren, are rendered still more sanguine,
<em>by the history of emancipation in the West Indies</em>.
It will be impossible for our countrymen, to close their
eyes against the light, which the working of the British
abolition act, will constantly throw on the duty and safety
of immediate emancipation.</p>

<p>We are nevertheless told, with surprising assurance, by
men great and small, that we have postponed the abolition
of Slavery, at least half a century; that our ultra doctrines
and violent measures have so incensed the South, that she
has settled down in the inflexible determination to keep her
slaves. Is this human nature? They who think so, seem
to imagine that the work of reform must be carried on solely<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_15"></a>[15]</span>
by coaxing and flattering the sinner: that a declaration of
his guilt and of his duty, sufficiently plain and unequivocal
to excite his displeasure, is the last way to bring him to repentance.
We think otherwise. We take the anger of the
South as a precious omen of success. The hit bird flutters.
She shows herself conscious of the truth of our charges.
Accuse a consistent temperance man of drunkenness, he will
smile in your face; accuse the drunkard himself and he will
be ready to fight you. The faithful reproof of sin always
irritates the sinner, and his irritation continues until he
either repents or forgets the admonition. Had our efforts
produced no such sensation among slave-holders, we should
be far more ready to despair. She believes unless this
discussion is stopped, Slavery must cease, or else she will
be disgraced in the eyes of the world, and exceedingly embarrassed
and trammeled in the possession of her slaves.
We do not, however, attribute all the wrath of the South
against us, to awakened conscience, and the anticipation of
our success. We have been shamefully misrepresented by
<em>northern</em> papers and mobs, which have not hesitated to
charge us with the worst of motives and the most hostile feelings
towards the South; as if we would gladly involve her in
a servile war. The belief of these calumnies has doubtless
excited her worst passions; and the moment she learns the
truth, it will create a re-action in our favor. Nor should it
be overlooked that many of her own citizens have no sympathy
for Slavery, and no strong prejudices against us. Facts
also show that argument can appease this very wrath, to
which our opponents attribute such indomitable energy.
When the students of Lane Seminary, under the Presidency
of the Rev. Dr. Beecher, commenced a discussion of the
subject of Slavery, about fifteen young men from the South,
all of them slave-holders or sons of slave-holders, were not a
little incensed at the faithful exposure of Slavery by their
fellow-students; but at the close of the discussion, all these
young men, save one, were thorough going Abolitionists;
and several of them are now lecturing in the free states for
the purpose of correcting our public sentiment, as a necessary
and infallible means of rectifying that of the South.</p>

<p>We believe, therefore, that if we succeed in abolitionizing
the North, we shall the South. Were the North already
abolitionized, we should do all the good specified above.
We should preserve our own liberties, virtue and religion,
and save the South from man’s greatest curse, his own voluntary<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_16"></a>[16]</span>
wickedness. Is it not, then, desirable that our sentiments
should prevail? Do they not carry with them the
clearest credentials of truth—the very best practical tendencies?
Is it not the grossest hypocrisy in the North to pretend
hostility to Slavery, when she refuses to do the good
which she would rejoice to do, were she a convert to abolitionism?
Is it not a crime in her to fight against the diffusion
of these sentiments? In one word—ought not the Abolitionists
to do all they can, in a constitutional and christian
manner, to propagate their views?</p>

<p>Success at the North is certain; for she has an interest in
destroying Slavery: her political principles are opposed to
it; and the great mass of her citizens are intelligent and virtuous,
unbought by southern patronage, and accustomed to
abhor cruelty and injustice. Our success is also written in
the desperate, but ineffectual endeavors of the opposition, to
prevent the agitation of the subject. By their own showing,
Slavery cannot endure the light of free inquiry. If northern
abettors of Slavery were not convinced, that the discussion
will inevitably abolitionize the mass of the people, they
would rely on argument rather than on lawless violence.
Our progress too, has already been astonishing. In the
course of three years nearly a thousand Anti-Slavery Societies
have been organized; many enemies have become
friends, and many opposers, the able advocates of our cause.
The prejudices of the people have been softened, and thousands
are now on the eve of joining us, who lately were our
most bitter antagonists. We have made all this progress
notwithstanding the abuse of the political and commercial
press has been heaped upon us without measure, and no man
could join us but at the peril of his reputation, if not also his
life and property. We are, therefore, encouraged to persevere.
What have we to accomplish, which we have not in
part achieved, while our powers and facilities are constantly
augmenting.</p>


<div class="chapter"></div>
<h2 class="nobreak">VINDICATION OF MEASURES.</h2>

<p>We propose to convert the country to our views by measures
which some of our opponents, (ashamed to deny our
doctrines,) allege to be the principal ground of their dissent.
We think they have failed to make a proper distinction between
our <em>measures</em> and the <em>abuse</em> of these measures. The
constitutional action of Congress, the pulpit, the press, public
debate, private conversation, anti-slavery societies, <em>these</em> are<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_17"></a>[17]</span>
our measures. If any of our associates, through human infirmity,
prosecute any of these measures in ill-temper or with
indiscretion, we regret and condemn it. The measures
themselves, and the prosecution of them we approve, and
shall now attempt to vindicate.</p>

<p>Some object to <em>our organizing Anti-Slavery Societies</em>,
which in our opinion they would not do, if they wished well
to our enterprise. For it is manifest that union gives us
strength, influence, courage, money and other facilities for
carrying on the work; it lays a foundation for concentrated,
permanent, economical effort. Societies have their stated
and occasional meetings, without giving offence and provoking
popular violence. They animate each other by
friendly correspondence, and prosecute their work systematically
and vigorously, by the gratuitous labors of their
most enlightened members. A general organization will
enable us to petition the various legislative bodies in behalf
of human rights, with unanimity and regularity, <ins class="corr" id="tn-17" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'until onr objects'">
until our objects</ins> are gained. We see other ends to be secured by it.
There is no disputing our constitutional right to adopt this
measure; which we believe any men of common sense
would adopt in our circumstances. Even the wisdom of
Christ sanctions the measure, for what <ins class="corr" id="tn-17a" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'is his chnrch'">
is his <em>church</em></ins> but a
<em>society</em> formed for the purpose of converting men to the
truth and progressively sanctifying them? Nor do we see
how we can testify to the South our abhorrence of Slavery
unless we form societies for the purpose. Had none been
formed, it might be doubted whether there are a thousand
decided Abolitionists in the country. It would be said in
Congress and believed at the South, that we are few in numbers,
and constantly becoming fewer and more contemptible.
The existence and rapidly increasing number of our <em>societies</em>
precludes the possibility of such misrepresentations and
mistakes. As soon as our plan is completed, in the formation
of a flourishing society in each village of the free states,
embodying a majority of the people, the South will know
what our public sentiment is. It will be concentrated upon
her. She will feel it. We learn from intelligent sources,
that the general opinion at the South now is, that all the citizens
of the North who are not Abolitionists, sympathize
with the slave-holders. It is natural they should think so.
We must, therefore, rank ourselves with the Abolitionists,
by joining an Anti-Slavery Society, if we would give our
decided testimony against the <span class="allsmcap">GREAT SOUTHERN SIN</span>.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_18"></a>[18]</span></p>

<p>Some object to <em>our employing itinerant lecturers</em>. We
think they would not object, if they had considered the matter
with friendly feelings. The subject of Slavery has so
many relations in this country, and involves so many questions
in morals, in biblical literature, in constitutional law,
in political economy, in history, and other departments of
learning, that our stated clergy, have not sufficient time for
its thorough investigation, were they disposed to make it.
We ought not to expect of them more than a faithful exposition
of the testimony of God against Slavery, and in favor of
immediate emancipation. As a general rule, they can do
no more. We need an extensive and thorough discussion of
the whole subject. Nor are all our clergymen yet Abolitionists.
Some are with us; others are against us. This
was to be expected. The subject has but just come before
the public mind. It found almost all our ministers colonizationists.
It would have been surprising, if they had all embraced
our views at the first blush, without discussion. We
don’t do things so in Connecticut. Hereafter we doubt not
they will all join us; but in the interim, we must employ
<ins class="corr" id="tn-18" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'intinerant lecturers'">
<em>itinerant</em> lecturers</ins>, if we would disseminate what we believe
to be the truth. And who will be harmed by it? The
truth will hurt no one; and even “error,” we quote the
words of Jefferson, “may safely be tolerated, so long as reason
is left free to combat it.” Some think it an interference
with the rights of the stated ministry to introduce an itinerant
lecturer, without the advice and consent of the settled
pastor. How so? Suppose there are several clergymen in
the same village. One of them being an Abolitionist does
all he can, by conversation, the distribution of papers, and
public lectures, to make the people Abolitionists, without distinction
of sect or party. Is that an interference with the
rights of the other pastors? No; such a course has never
been thought so. Nor is there the least difference in the
two cases. The several churches introduce these pastors to
be their teachers. We, the Abolitionists, another body of
people, introduce a man to teach on a particular subject.
We have the right; he has a right to come; therefore no
right is violated.<a id="FNanchor_1" href="#Footnote_1" class="fnanchor">[1]</a></p>

<p><em>Some object to our employing severe epithets in speaking<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_19"></a>[19]</span>
of Slavery and slave-holders.</em> They say our condemnation
is too hard, denunciatory and indiscriminate. We wish all
who allege this against us would illustrate their meaning
and sustain their charge by quoting the offensive expressions.
It would put them to great inconvenience. They
may think the language “hard” and “too hard,” when it
barely expresses what ought to be said, and cannot be better
said. We do indeed tell slave-holders their sins plainly,
calling things by their right names; but it is only in the
conclusion of an argument to prove the charge, that we
justify making it. Nor is our language any harder than
the sober language of moral philosophers, and of the most
eminent fathers of the church. Wesley says: “You, [the
slave-holder,] first acted the villain in making them slaves,
whether you stole them or bought them.” “This equally
concerns all slave-holders, of whatever rank and degree:
seeing <em>men-buyers are exactly on a level with men-stealers</em>.”
The younger President Edwards says: “To hold a man in
a state of Slavery is to be every day guilty of <em>robbing</em> him
of his liberty, or of <em>man-stealing</em>.” Grotius says: “Those
are men-stealers, who abduct, <em>keep</em>, sell or buy <em>slaves</em> or freemen.
To steal a man is the highest kind of theft.” Adam
Clarke says: “Among the heathen Slavery was in some
sort excusable; among <em>christians</em> it is <span class="allsmcap">AN ENORMITY AND
A CRIME FOR WHICH PERDITION HAS SCARCELY AN ADEQUATE
STATE OF PUNISHMENT</span>.” We use no language
more hard, more true, or more indiscriminate. We think
these great men understood how to do good, at least as well
as our critics. We are also fully persuaded, that the South
is far less incensed at our <em>language</em> than at our <em>sentiments</em>.
She is indignant at what we say, not the manner of saying it.
Dr. Channing had this vulgar prejudice, that we were injuring
our cause by using abusive language. And Mr. Leigh
of Virginia, took the very book, in which he reproves us,
and quoted passages which he declared in the United States
Senate, rivalled the most insulting language of Garrison. So
difficult is it to tell the truth about Slavery in palatable
terms.</p>

<p>We are also censured for <em>sending pictures to the South
illustrative of the horrors of Slavery</em>. We do indeed employ
the art of painting, as well as the arts of printing and
speaking, to awaken sympathy for the Slave; but our pictures
are designed for the North, not the South. Though
some of them may find their way there, they are <em>never sent</em><span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_20"></a>[20]</span>
to the slaves, are not apt to fall into their hands, and not
adapted to make them uneasy and turbulent. Were they
painted as large as life, and set up at the corner of every
street and on every plantation, the sole effect would be to
awe the slaves into subjection, by reminding them of the
consequences of disobedience.</p>

<p>We are accused of <em>sending papers to the slaves</em>. The
charge is false. Our publications are sent exclusively to
the free white population. Were it in our power to send to
the slaves, we should indeed rejoice at it. If they could read
and the mails would carry them papers, we would prepare
tracts on purpose for them, explaining the doctrines and duties
of christianity, inculcating the forgiveness of injuries,
the patient endurance of wrong, the faithful service of their
masters, until such time as they <em>can be made free</em>. We
would even send them the Bible, which says: “Woe unto
him that buildeth his house by unrighteousness and his
chambers by wrong; <em>that useth his neighbor’s service without
wages and giveth him not for his work</em>.” Jer. xxii, 13.</p>

<p>The foregoing are current objections to <em>specific</em> measures
of the Abolitionists. There are other objections of a more
general and sweeping character, which go to condemn <em>all</em>
our measures, calling upon us to disband our societies, to dismiss
our agents, to break up our printing presses, and interfere
in no way with Southern Slavery. We can give these
only a brief notice.</p>

<p>It is a current objection to our enterprise, that <em>Slavery is
no concern of ours</em>: that the South alone is interested in the
subject, and we have no right to <em>interfere</em>. Interference is a
very indefinite term. We acknowledge we have no right
to interfere by force of arms; and have ever disclaimed the
intention of interfering, except by the constitutional and
peaceable action of Congress, and the application of truth to
the hearts and consciences of our southern brethren. As to
our having no right to interfere in <em>this manner</em>, because
Slavery is no concern of ours, it is a strange doctrine to be
promulgated in the nineteenth century by republicans and
christians. What interest had we in the struggle of Greece
and Poland with Turkish and Russian despotism? What concern
have we in the moral and political degradation of the
Hindoo, Hottentot and Chinese? We have the answer in
the motto of the christian church: <span class="smcap">Our country is the
world, our countrymen mankind</span>. As christians we
are concerned for the spiritual welfare of all classes at the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_21"></a>[21]</span>
South; the great mass of whom are now sunk in infidelity
and vice. Their alarming destitution of the means of religion,
and the general corruption of their morals, are justly
attributed to Slavery. What would become of the virtue, intelligence
and religious institutions of Meriden, if all the real
estate and all the inhabitants of the town, were held as property
by one man? He might be an infidel; and if he were
a christian, what dependence could be placed on him to
support the gospel, or what confidence would the oppressed
people have in his religion? Such is the state of things at
the South. Slavery not only creates a distaste for true religion,
but withdraws from its support the laboring class,
which in every free country, embodies a great proportion of
the most devoted and liberal christians. <ins class="corr" id="tn-21" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'Their is also'">
There is also</ins> much in the habits which Slavery fosters, to indispose pious youth
to enter the ministry and to disqualify them for its laborious
duties; while many who enter upon the work, abandon it for
secular pursuits, or remove to the free states, where they can
preach the <em>whole</em> gospel with more security and success.
Not only must a slave-holding community be destitute of men
and means to make known the way of salvation, but the
preaching of the gospel will generally be inefficacious with
all classes; with the <em>masters</em>, for Slavery fosters in them the
worst passions of human nature, affords them facilities for
the unbounded indulgence of their appetites, and relieves
them from the necessity of personal exertion for a livelihood;
with the <em>poor white population</em>, for Slavery accumulates the
wealth of the community in a few hands, renders free labor
disreputable, and multiplies temptations to low and degrading
vices; with the <em>free people of color</em>, for Slavery holds
most of them in a state of abject poverty, ignorance and sin;
with the <em>slaves</em>, for Slavery robs them of the bible, of self-control,
of hope, of parent, wife and child, of the best motives
to be virtuous, and of the best evidences of christianity;
it makes them vicious; it makes them sceptics. We are
concerned for these perishing millions.</p>

<p>Slavery is a concern of ours for it involves our personal
interests. It throws back upon us a moral pestilence; it scatters
the seeds of intemperance, licentiousness, and infidelity;
it popularizes gambling, Sabbath breaking, profaneness and
lawless violence; it casts an undeserved stigma on manual
labor, it encourages idleness and prodigality. It disgraces us
in the eyes of the whole world; it impairs our national
strength; it encroaches on the spirit of liberty; it is constantly<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_22"></a>[22]</span>
undermining our free institutions. The northern
states have no greater enemy. Were Slavery abolished, her
religion, her morals, her liberties, her general prosperity
would be far more secure. The chief source of danger
to the integrity of our union, and to our domestic tranquility
would be removed; a greater market would be opened for
our manufactures, and a wider field for our industry <ins class="corr" id="tn-22" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'and enterprize; the'">
and enterprise; the</ins> emancipated slaves would purchase our goods,
and our youth could enter into competition with the sons of
the South in raising cotton, &amp;c. without becoming slave-holders.
Labor would soon cease to be disgraceful; property
would accumulate in every part of the land; education would
flourish; religion would revive; the entire country would
rejoice in peace and plenty under the smiles of an approving
providence. Tell us not, that we have no concern in
removing the greatest sin, curse and shame of the nation, and
in securing for ourselves and our posterity, a truly free and
virtuous government.</p>

<p>It is said that <em>Slavery is an agitating subject, which cannot
be discussed without disturbing the peace and harmony
of our churches</em>. Why so? This subject can be discussed
in the churches in Great Britain without discord and
division. We think it could be here, were it not for the
corruption of our public sentiment, which can be corrected
only by free discussion. It is where the truth needs most to be
heard, that it creates most opposition and variance. Primitive
christianity was accused of turning the world upside down.
The temperance cause has occasioned strife, and separated
“very friends.” We hold to the Apostolic injunction:
“<em>first</em> pure, <em>then</em> peaceable.” We love a virtuous peace. A
truce with sin we abhor. If we must surrender our liberties,
and connive at iniquity, to avoid a war, we say with
Patrick Henry, “The war is inevitable, and let it come; I
repeat it, sir, let it come.” Who does not see that if polygamy
were common in our churches, it would create a terrible
excitement to preach against it, and lead to the dismission
of pastors? Yet any one would acknowledge, that
religion could never prosper, while the church was so
corrupt; and that she had better be torn into ten thousand
fragments, than that polygamy should continue in vogue;
for she would soon be re-organized in greater purity
and strength. So it is with a <em>slave-holding</em> Church; and
with a Church in which the <em>spirit</em> of Slavery is so rife, that
she will not live in peace with her Anti-Slavery members,<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_23"></a>[23]</span>
nor tolerate the exercise of their Constitutional rights. But
we do not believe this of our Churches. We think the
more this “delicate and agitating” subject is discussed
among us, the less unpleasant excitement will prevail.</p>

<p>It is said <em>that our measures to overthrow Slavery are unconstitutional</em>.
Our opponents may easily test this question
by bringing it before the U. S. Court. We claim to be acting
constitutionally. Our plan of operations is essentially the
same as that pursued by the early Anti-Slavery Societies,
of which such men as John Jay, Benj. Franklin, Benj.
Rush, and Jonathan Edwards, were active members; some
of whom were engaged in forming our federal Constitution.
Did they not understand that instrument? Did their contemporaries
ever dispute their right to discuss the merits
of Slavery? Have not our citizens, from time immemorial
and without restriction, exercised this right? Does not the
Constitution, instead of guaranteeing Slavery against this
moral influence, guarantee to us the right of employing it,
by forbidding Congress to pass any law abridging the freedom
of speech and of the press?</p>

<p>We are told our measures are an <em>invasion of the rights
of property</em>. This objection assumes, what nature denies,
that <em>man</em> may be <em>rightfully</em> held as property. Blackstone
maintains in his Commentaries, that man cannot be reduced
by any just process to a state of absolute Slavery; that he
cannot be born in that state, nor sell himself into it, nor be
placed there when taken captive in war, without flagrant
injustice. We also hold it to be <em>self-evident</em>, that all men are
<em>born free and equal</em>, and entitled to certain <em>inalienable</em> rights,
among which are life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness.
The Slave owns himself by grant of his Creator. <em>Slavery</em>
is, therefore, an invasion of his rights of property. It is
the slave-master who makes an aggression on the property
of others, not we, who exhort him to relinquish that
property. The Slaves being the rightful owners of themselves,
the abolition of Slavery is merely an act declarative
of this indisputable title. Nor do we seek the destruction
of Slavery, except through the constitutional authorities.
Even were the slaves the <em>property</em> of their masters,
it would be lawful for us to <em>persuade</em> them to part with it.
Would it not? The Legislatures of the several states have
a right to abolish Slavery. Have they not? It has hitherto
been conceded, that the law making power of every<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_24"></a>[24]</span>
slave-holding country has this right. May we not then
persuade the states to exercise it, by convincing them of
the moral wrong and frightful impolicy of Slavery? Should
it be said that the government encouraged its citizens to
invest property under the protection of the slave code, and
therefore ought not to abolish Slavery without indemnifying
them, our answer is, that mankind are under a paramount
obligation not to invest property under the protection
of <em>immoral</em> laws; that all such laws are in their nature null
and void from the beginning; that governments have always
exercised the power of correcting abuses; and
there is no greater abuse than Slavery; none more unjust
and oppressive; none more pernicious and perilous to our
national interests.</p>

<p>Some object, that the abolition of Slavery <em>on our plan</em>,
without compensation to the masters, <em>would be taking away
the bread of poor widows and orphans</em>. We have no plan.
We say only, that Slavery is wrong, and ought forthwith to
be abandoned. The South will adopt and prosecute her
own plan. When her Legislatures abolish Slavery, they
can, if they will, provide for widows and children, who are
left destitute by that act. If they will not do it, we will
raise contributions for their relief; for we deem the claims
of <em>charity</em>, nearly as imperative as the claims of justice.
But we can never sanction the <em>principle</em> of Slavery, by
saying, that slave-holders have a <em>right</em> to compensation for
restoring to the slaves their stolen rights. We must always
consider it a greater hardship to be unjustly held as a slave,
than to be made poor by freeing such slave. It is a sad
blunder in morals, that this man may make that man, perhaps
fifty other men, poor for life, lest he himself should
be a pauper; that this man may make that man poor by
<em>dishonesty</em>, lest he himself should become poor by <em>being
honest</em>.</p>

<p>No objection to our measures is more senseless, or more
common, than an <em>alleged tendency to dissolve the Union</em>.
Which had we better surrender, the Union or our liberties?
The Union is a curse instead of a blessing, if we must
surrender for it, <em>freedom of speech and personal protection
in any part of the country</em>. And if Slavery continues to be
protected by public sentiment, and by popular violence,
how long could the Union last, even were <em>all</em> the abolitionists
this day laid in their graves? Slavery endangers the<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_25"></a>[25]</span>
integrity of the Union, more than all other enemies; and
unless soon destroyed, will be the destroyer both of it and
us. If we love the Union, we should labor to overthrow
Slavery. Wesley somewhere defines fanaticism, to be the
expectation of accomplishing ends without the use of
means. Let us not hope for the peaceable destruction of
Slavery, by such a fanatical course. Let us do <em>something</em>;
and if we do any thing, what can be done which the abolitionists
are not attempting? In doing this we shall not
peril the Union, but preserve it. The South will never
venture on the mad experiment of secession, <em>because</em> the
North is opposed to Slavery. Such an act would be suicidal.
It would encourage the slaves to revolt. It would
leave her defenceless against the invasion of a foreign foe.
It would release us from <ins class="corr" id="tn-25" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the constistutional'">
the constitutional</ins> obligation to
suppress domestic violence, and to restore fugitives from
service. It would open several thousand miles of frontier,
over which her slaves would escape into a land of liberty.
It would make the south “a good country to emigrate
from,” and she would find herself losing her best citizens,
and her condition becoming more and more exposed and
perilous. She would be ruined. She knows it. Were our
legislators in Congress to retort her stereotyped threat to
dissolve the Union, with a challenge to do it, if she dares,
we should hear no more of this empty bravado.</p>

<p>It is said, if our measures should be successful, <em>the
slaves would resort to the North</em>, and coming up upon our
farms, and into our shops, like the frogs of Egypt, reduce
the wages of our laborers. No apprehension is more
groundless. The free colored people of the South are
quite numerous, and very much oppressed; yet few of
them leave that part of the country; though the whites
would be very glad to have them do so, because they render
the slaves uneasy, and come into competition with slave
labor. But were slavery abolished, the whites would desire
to retain all the colored people, in order to employ
them in cultivating the soil; precisely as is now the case
in the West Indies. Nor would the slaves be willing to
leave the land of their nativity, and of their kindred, to reside
in the cold regions of the north, to the business and
climate of which they are uninured, and where they must
labor more severely to obtain a comfortable living. But<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_26"></a>[26]</span>
should they come, what then? Do you prefer perpetual
slavery?</p>

<p>It is also objected to our enterprise, that <em>the immediate
abolition of slavery, would be “letting the slaves loose” to
be idlers, vagabonds, thieves, and cut-throats</em>. This objection
is more forcible against <em>gradual</em> emancipation, which
would throw upon society a multitude of freedmen, while
the rest of their brethren still remained in bondage. The
holders of slaves would not encourage the free by giving
them labor; who would, therefore, be more apt to be idle
and vicious; while their release would excite uneasiness
in the minds of the unemancipated. The objection is also
equally strong against <em>prospective</em> emancipation, according
to which the slaves would all be set free at once; but not
until some time after the passage of the act. Experience
and human nature both teach us, that slaves under such
circumstances are more apt to be overworked, than to be
better prepared for the enjoyment of freedom. The objection
is, therefore, good for <em>perpetual</em> slavery, or good for
nothing. It is good for nothing. Immediate emancipation
would indeed deliver the slave and his family at once from
the hands of an irresponsible master, and empower him to
go where he pleases and do what he pleases, so long as he
breaks none of the laws which restrain other men. And
why not? He could not otherwise rejoin his wife and
children, whom the slave trade has torn from him, nor
secure fair wages, nor be safe from oppression. But this
is <ins class="corr" id="tn-26" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'not lettting him'">
not letting him</ins> loose <em>to do evil</em>. <span class="smcap">The laws of slavery
let the masters loose upon the slaves</span>, <em>instead of the
abolition of slavery letting the slaves loose upon the masters</em>.
Were there a law authorizing the inhabitants of Meriden
to seize the inhabitants of Berlin, to confine them to jail
limits, and work them without wages, to separate husbands
and wives, parents and children, and even to kill
them by that very indefinite thing, called “moderate correction;”
this law would let the inhabitants of Meriden
loose upon the inhabitants of Berlin; for it would protect
the former in the grossest outrages upon the latter. But
the repeal of this law would not let the inhabitants of Berlin
loose upon us. Extending them protection would not
be letting them loose upon us. Had we the power of
repealing the law; or if not, possessing the power of <em>not
enforcing</em> it, we should find our security in doing so. The<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_27"></a>[27]</span>
very way to make them respect <em>our</em> rights, would be to respect
<em>theirs</em>. Immediate emancipation places the slaves
under the <em>control</em> as well as protection of the laws of the
State against idleness, vagrancy, theft, murder, and all
other aggressions on the rights of men.</p>

<p>We are told that the <em>Slaves are not fit to be free</em>; and
therefore our scheme of immediate emancipation, if adopted,
would prove a curse to them and the country. Nothing
is more false. The Slaves are <em>men</em>; and therefore they
are more fit for freedom than for slavery; more fit to be
treated as persons than as things; to be governed by appeals
to the reason and conscience than by brute force.
God made man to be free and adapted him to that condition.
A state of Slavery is unnatural to him. Nor can his nature
so change, that he shall be more fit to be treated as a brute,
than as a free moral agent. Slaves have often been set at
liberty, and have <em>always</em> proved their capacity for freedom,
by their industry, frugality and ready obedience to the laws.</p>

<p>And why, we would ask, should they be thought unfit to
be put under the control and protection of the same laws,
which govern freemen? Do their vices or their ignorance,
disqualify them? While Slavery lasts, they will remain
equally degraded.</p>

<p>Are they <em>Sabbath breakers</em>? Slavery has taught them
to desecrate the day of rest, by making it to them almost the
only day of recreation, the only day for visiting, for trading
and for tilling their gardens. Are they <em>thieves</em>? They
consider stealing from their masters to be only making <em>reprisals</em>
for the robbery of their just wages; while many of
them are strongly tempted to steal by the desire of more or
better food. Are they <em>liars</em>? They will continue such,
while they are slaves. They will pretend sickness, to
avoid labor; they will say they do not wish to be free, lest
their masters should sell them into distant banishment; they
will lie to conceal the unavoidable delinquences, <ins class="corr" id="tn-27" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'for while slaves'">
for which slaves</ins> are daily upbraided and beaten. Are they <em>idle</em>? As
slaves they have no hope of reward to stimulate their exertions.
They will work much better, as one facetiously
expresses it, for Mr. <span class="smcap">Cash</span> than for Mr. <span class="smcap">Lash</span>. Let their
wives and children be dependent on their industry for support,
a far more noble and efficient motive than the fear of
violence, to call forth the energies of man. Are they <em>improvident</em>?
They cannot learn to save property, until they<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_28"></a>[28]</span>
are allowed to hold it in their own right. Make them free,
and then that faculty of their nature, which the phrenologists
call “acquisitiveness” will prompt them to save their
earnings. Are they <em>licentious</em>? Then give them their
liberty, that the husband and father may be the legal
protector of his wife and daughters. Are they <em>revengeful</em>?
Redress their wrongs, and they will forgive their oppressors.
Are they <em>heathen</em>? Take your foot from their necks,
before you disgrace christianity, by attempting to convert
them. Are they <em>ignorant of letters</em>? So are a majority of
the freemen of the world; nor is it to be expected that
slave-holders will teach their slaves to read and write, until
they repent of Slavery itself. The vices of the Slaves are
inseparable from their condition. If they are not now fit
for freedom, Slavery, which unfitted them, will perpetuate
their unfitness. Nor is their degradation of mind and morals
a disqualification for freedom. You may find its counterpart
in the characters of a large class of citizens in every
country.</p>

<p>While Slavery continues, what is the prospect of their
becoming <em>better</em> fitted for freedom? Where are the men
and the means? Who will teach them? Who will support
the teachers? The south cannot supply her <em>free</em> population
with instruction. Even with the aid of the north,
she is very destitute of the means of religion. Nor would
she be willing to adopt a general system of education for the
improvement of the Slaves. Instead of giving her money
to fit them for freedom, she would hunt from society
any persons, who should seriously propose the measure.
They know little of the spirit of Slavery, who imagine, that
the south was disposed to prepare her Slaves for freedom,
until the abolitionists roused her to resistance. Had she
really wished to free her Slaves, she would have welcomed
us as coadjutors, at least she would not have abandoned
her own plan, because ours was offensive to her. She never
intended to fit her Slaves for freedom. She does not intend
it now. Her laws, in most of the States, are against
it. The mass of her Slaves will, no doubt, be as unfit for
freedom fifty years hence, if Slavery should continue so
long, as they are to day. The British abolitionists were
once deceived by this syren song of preparation, but now
in allusion to the words of Paul; “the <em>glorious</em> gospel of the
blessed God;” they exclaim, <span class="allsmcap">THE GLORIOUS DOCTRINE OF<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_29"></a>[29]</span>
IMMEDIATE EMANCIPATION</span>! They found it the <span class="smcap">power of
God</span>, to awaken the slumbering conscience of the nation;
and the <span class="smcap">wisdom of God</span> as a measure of relief to their
Slaves. We shall find it so.</p>

<p>Our opponents also object to <em>emancipation upon the soil</em>.
Not all, but some of them, are in favor of Colonization as
a remedy for Slavery, and others execrate us for our opposition
to it as a scheme for benefiting Africa. We are
especially averse to the former class. When men say,
that the Slaves ought not to be freed, until they can be colonized,
we <em>ought to make resistance</em>, for the following reasons:</p>

<p>1. We ought to <em>resist every wicked prejudice</em>; and they
who object to emancipation on the soil, do so, in obedience
to such a prejudice. They say the colored people can
never rise in this country. They maintain that our aversion
to the race is instinctive and natural; though we find no
one averse to associating with them as <em>slaves</em>. The two
races are certainly on very <em>intimate</em> terms at the South.
It is only when they come as <em>freemen</em> between the wind
and our nobility, that they taint the air. We, therefore,
say, this prejudice is unnatural and sinful; and instead of
fostering it, we ought to rebuke, and check it in ourselves
and others. Some of us recollect the time, when as Colonizationists
we wished to get rid of the colored people, and
were indignant at them for being unwilling to leave the
country. May we not repent of such a feeling and condemn
in it others, without being hunted from society?</p>

<p>2. <em>By retaining the emancipated slaves on the soil, we can
at less expense of men and means educate and christianize
them.</em> Were we to send them beyond the Mississippi or to
Africa, it would take ten times the number of Missionaries
and Teachers, that we are now supporting among the
heathen, to save them from sinking into barbarism. But
if they should be retained as free laborers in the service of
their present masters, those masters would provide for their
instruction, and without diverting means from other objects,
the delightful spectacle would soon be witnessed of Schools
and Churches springing up among them, through the voluntary
efforts of the ministers and christians of the South.</p>

<p>3. <em>The labor of the Slaves is wanted on the plantations at
the South.</em> To withdraw such an amount of labor would
bankrupt the entire country. Nor could their places be<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_30"></a>[30]</span>
supplied, except by the worst population of the old world;
by men, whose religion, whose morals, whose politics are
all, in the highest degree, hostile to our national interests.
The emancipated Slaves, on the contrary, would be prejudiced
in favor of the protestant faith, and prove the
staunchest friends of our free institutions.</p>

<p>4. The <em>South will not consent to the colonization of the
Slaves</em>. She is willing we should contribute to carry off
the free people of color, “the nuisances,” “the disturbing
force,” as she terms them; and also those Slaves, whom
the more conscientious of her citizens, who dare not die
Slave-holders, may emancipate for the purpose. But she
is unwilling we should go a step further. She does not believe
we can get the means of doing more. We think, if a
place were provided in Africa, and we had the means necessary
to transport every Slave there, and were to go and
tell the south, about the sinfulness of holding Slaves, when
they <em>can</em> be colonized, and call upon her in <em>good earnest</em>, to
give them up, she would denounce us as fanatics, and pass
no more resolutions in favor of colonization. She is now
at peace with it, because she does not fear it, and hopes to
find it of use in repelling the abolitionists, in <em>letting off</em>, as
by a safety valve, the pious feeling of her own citizens,
and in expelling the free people of color.</p>

<p>5. The Slaves <em>are unwilling to leave the country</em>; and
will never consent to do it, but on such a dread alternative
as no christian people should impose. <em>First</em> give them
their liberty, put them under the protection of impartial
law, and treat them with kindness, and then if they <em>ask</em> our
aid to remove their families to Africa, their determination
to leave this country will evidently be spontaneous.</p>

<p>6. <em>It is better for them to remain in the employment of
southern capitalists, who are able to pay them wages for their
labor than to go out into the wilderness as paupers, where
there is no capital, and the very necessaries of life, are to be
created.</em></p>

<p>7. <em>They cannot be colonized without an appalling expense
of money, life and comfort.</em></p>

<p>8. To colonize the Slaves of this country <em>on account of
their color, would be in the highest degree dishonorable to
christianity</em>. Were Christ on earth, he would associate
with the despised colored man in preference to many who
think themselves <ins class="corr" id="tn-30" title="Transcriber’s Note—Original text: 'the best soeiety'">
the best society</ins>. Can we act, as he<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_31"></a>[31]</span>
would not and yet exemplify his religion? What, too, would
be the effect on the minds of the heathen, nearly all of whom
are <em>colored</em> men, were they to learn, that that nation, which
makes the loudest professions of attachment to christianity,
had banished more than two millions of her citizens to a
land of pagan darkness, being offended at the <em>color of their
skin</em>?</p>

<p>9. To <em>send all the slaves to Africa would be fatal to the
natives of that Continent</em>. Said Mr. Pinney, agent of the
Colonization Society, and once Gov. of Liberia, ‘the colony
must be kept pure, or it will either enslave or exterminate
the African tribes.’ Send 2,500,000 of people to Africa,
four-fifths of whom are in heathenish darkness, and
all of whom have been taught, by the example of their masters,
that slavery is morally right, and labor disgraceful,
would they hesitate to buy Slaves of the native Princes, or
to reduce their captives to a state of servitude? It is said,
there is as strong a line of demarkation between the colonists,
and the heathen, though of the same color, as there
is between the white and colored people in this country.
But if they should not become slave-holders, would they not
gradually exterminate the native tribes for the sake of revenging
injuries, and possessing themselves of their lands?
Said Mr. Pinney, the colony must be kept pure, or such a
result is inevitable; and it cannot be kept pure, unless it is
conducted on a very small scale. We doubt whether a
commercial and military colony can be so far controlled
by <em>moral principle</em>, as to avoid these results. For if the
emigrants were all pious persons, and few in number, their
posterity might become both vicious and powerful. We
are not, therefore, without our objections to African colonization,
even if it should be distinctly abandoned as a
remedy for slavery, and conducted with caution, and
on a small scale. We know not to what it may grow.
We like better, the good, old, apostolic plan of sending <em>missionaries</em>
to the heathen—men, who have no commercial
and selfish interests to subserve, and who bear no hostile
weapons. There is danger that a colony, however carefully
guarded, will <em>misrepresent christianity</em> and fatally
prejudice the native mind against it. The fact, that not a
native has yet been converted to christianity, in connection
with the colony of Liberia, justifies the inquiry, whether the
<em>scheme</em> is a good one for Africa. The transportation of all
our Slaves would confessedly form a colony too large and<span class="pagenum"><a id="Page_32"></a>[32]</span>
corrupt for the safety of the native tribes; and we tremble
for the result of the present <em>experiment</em>.</p>

<p>In this argument we have not denied the practicability of
colonizing two millions and a half of people, at an expense
of $125,000,000. We think it enough to show the thing
ought not to be done.</p>


<h2 class="nobreak">CONCLUSION.</h2>

<p>With this view of our sentiments, of their practical value,
and of the propriety and wisdom of our measures, we leave
you to judge whether abolitionists deserve to be out-lawed in
their own country; to be loaded with abuse and contumely;
to be denied a right, conceded to all other decent men, of
advocating their cause in our public halls and churches;
and to be left, unprotected, to the violence of ill-minded
men? We beg you also to consider, how terrific would be
the prospects of our country, were we in obedience to popular
clamor, to disband our societies, and retire from the
field. Who would ever again venture to raise his voice in
behalf of the down-trodden slave? Should any one have
the temerity to do it, how soon would he be overwhelmed
by the violence of the pro-slavery party, encouraged by
past success, and maddened by the remembrance of the
formidable array of talent, wealth, and piety, which they
once encountered. We verily believe, that the peaceable
abolition of Slavery depends, under God, on our perseverance.
Moral means must continue to be used by us until
they issue in success, or slavery will terminate in a bloody
revolution. We anticipate such an event, as a possibility,
with painful emotions; and feel disposed to look, in the use
of all lawful means, to that God, who has promised to do
for us, exceeding abundantly above all that we can ask or
think, that so dire a catastrophe may be averted. We
earnestly solicit your co-operation.</p>

<p>We might have said much more to correct misapprehensions,
refute calumnies, and fortify our positions; but our
limits forbid it. We may have said some things, which you
will disapprove; for we have ingenuously confessed our
most obnoxious sentiments; but if you will give us credit
for sincerity and weigh our arguments, we shall expect to
stand better in your opinion, than our calumniators would
have us.</p>

of this license, apply to copying and distributing Project

and may not be used if you charge for an eBook, except by following
the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation
of derivative works, reports, performances and research. Project
Gutenberg eBooks may be modified and printed and given away&#8212;you may
do practically ANYTHING in the United States with eBooks not protected

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>

    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or

must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any

Gutenberg&#8482; License.

any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.

        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue

        works.

</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,

the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
